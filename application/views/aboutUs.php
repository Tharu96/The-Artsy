                                <h4 style="color: #bfbfbf">THE ARTISY Foundation is an association of artists and a non-profit organization that aims to connect patrons and lovers of art with unique, independent artists, and create a positive difference to the society. ArtD’Hope Foundation is a section 8 Non Profit Company  A section 8 Non Profit company may be formed for “promoting commerce, art, science, charity or any other useful object.” ArtD’Hope operates differently from other non-profit organizations; it has a two-fold aim to generate income with the help of art and artists, and contribute a portion of this income to social causes assessed and selected by THE ARTYSY.

                                    We strongly believe that the gift of seeing the beauty and expression of art should be an opportunity for as many people as possible; hence our primary cause is to help individuals suffering from curable cases of visual impairment or blindness. WHO estimates there to be 39 million people afflicted with blindness globally, of which 80% were preventable or are curable. India has the largest population of blind people in the world, and ArtD’Hope’s long term mission is to reduce the number of blind people in India.

                                    We are committed to helping as many as we can, through the generosity and support of its artists and patrons. ArtD’Hope is happy to extend its support to other social causes or community initiatives.</h4>
